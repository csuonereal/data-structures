# Data Structures in Python

This repository contains basic Python implementations of fundamental data structures. The focus is on simplicity and clarity, covering essential types.

## Implemented Data Structures

### 1. Arrays
- **Static Array**: Fixed-size array with basic operations.
- **Dynamic Array**: Resizable array implementation.

### 2. Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List**: Linear list with nodes pointing to the next node.

### 3. Stacks
- **Stack using Arrays**: Stack implementation based on an array.
- **Stack using Linked List**: Stack implementation using a linked list.

### 4. Queues
- **Queue using Arrays**: Queue implementation based on an array.
- **Queue using Linked List**: Queue implementation using a linked list.

### 5. Trees
- **Binary Tree**: General tree structure.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Sorted binary tree for efficient searching.
- **AVL Tree**: Self-balancing binary search tree.
